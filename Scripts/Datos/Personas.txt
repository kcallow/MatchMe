koki	0	10/10/67	Perez	Hofstadter	Juan	M	0	“In the end, we self-perceiving, self-inventing, locked-in mirages are little miracles of self-reference.” 
gago	0	10/11/67	Chavez	Sanchez	Carlos	M	1	“Every man has his secret sorrows which the world knows not; and often times we call a man cold when he is only sad.” 
jua345	0	10/12/67	Jimenez	Kuhn	Pablo	M	0	“There are wounds that never show on the body that are deeper and more hurtful than anything that bleeds.”
kkkus	0	10/13/67	Caceres	Kaiser	Pedro	M	1	“Whenever you read a cancer booklet or website or whatever, they always list depression among the side effects of cancer. But, in fact, depression is not a side effect of cancer. Depression is a side effect of dying.” 
rameno	0	10/14/67	Suarez	Feuerbach	Justin	M	0	“That's the thing about depression: A human being can survive almost anything, as long as she sees the end in sight. But depression is so insidious, and it compounds daily, that it's impossible to ever see the end.” 
tadeo	0	10/15/67	Hidalgo	Freud	Gerardo	M	1	 “Noble deeds and hot baths are the best cures for depression.” 
semejis	0	10/16/67	Matamoros	Marx	Yassir	M	0	“There is no point treating a depressed person as though she were just feeling sad, saying, 'There now, hang on, you'll get over it.' Sadness is more or less like a head cold- with patience, it passes. Depression is like cancer.” 
cataclism0	0	10/17/67	Oppenheim	Kant	Luis	M	1	“I can't eat and I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in terms of being a functional human, you know?” 
lopera	0	10/18/67	Goldbach	Frege	Yaffet	M	0	“When you're surrounded by all these people, it can be lonelier than when you're by yourself. You can be in a huge crowd, but if you don't feel like you can trust anyone or talk to anybody, you feel like you're really alone.” 
sameda	0	10/19/67	Heisenberg	Nietzsche	Yeremi	M	1	“Do you not see how necessary a world of pains and troubles is to school an intelligence and make it a soul?” 
ouita56	0	10/20/67	Duden	Goedel	Juana	F	0	 “That is all I want in life: for this pain to seem purposeful.” 
darx666	0	10/21/67	Riemann	Einstein	Carla	F	1	“Listen to the people who love you. Believe that they are worth living for even when you don't believe it. Seek out the memories depression takes away and project them into the future. Be brave; be strong; take your pills. Exercise because it's good for you even if every step weighs a thousand pounds. Eat when food itself disgusts you. Reason with yourself when you have lost your reason.” 
firehead	0	10/22/67	Pfeiser	Cantor	Paola	F	0	“Mental pain is less dramatic than physical pain, but it is more common and also more hard to bear. The frequent attempt to conceal mental pain increases the burden: it is easier to say “My tooth is aching” than to say “My heart is broken.” 
sugoisugoi	0	10/23/67	Hannemann	Perez	Pedra	F	1	“I don't want to see anyone. I lie in the bedroom with the curtains drawn and nothingness washing over me like a sluggish wave. Whatever is happening to me is my own fault. I have done something wrong, something so huge I can't even see it, something that's drowning me. I am inadequate and stupid, without worth. I might as well be dead.” 
momo	0	10/24/67	Riemel	Chavez	Justina	F	0	“I didn’t want my picture taken because I was going to cry. I didn’t know why I was going to cry, but I knew that if anybody spoke to me or looked at me too closely the tears would fly out of my eyes and the sobs would fly out of my throat and I’d cry for a week. I could feel the tears brimming and sloshing in me like water in a glass that is unsteady and too full.” 
sabeta	0	10/25/67	Rosenbach	Jimenez	Gerarda	F	1	“It's not all bad. Heightened self-consciousness, apartness, an inability to join in, physical shame and self-loathing—they are not all bad. Those devils have been my angels. Without them I would never have disappeared into language, literature, the mind, laughter and all the mad intensities that made and unmade me.” 
jugorta	0	10/26/67	Haendel	Caceres	Yassira	F	0	“Its so hard to talk when you want to kill yourself. That's above and beyond everything else, and it's not a mental complaint-it's a physical thing, like it's physically hard to open your mouth and make the words come out. They don't come out smooth and in conjunction with your brain the way normal people's words do; they come out in chunks as if from a crushed-ice dispenser; you stumble on them as they gather behind your lower lip. So you just keep quiet.” 
faas	0	10/27/67	Schaefer	Suarez	Luisa	F	1	 “I don't want any more of this try, try again stuff. I just want out. I’ve had it. I am so tired. I am twenty and I am already exhausted.” 
lopiunes	0	10/28/67	Oetinger	Hidalgo	Yaffeta	F	0	 “I waste at least an hour every day lying in bed. Then I waste time pacing. I waste time thinking. I waste time being quiet and not saying anything because I'm afraid I'll stutter.” 
grepa	0	10/29/67	Pilsener	Goethe	Yeremia	F	1	 “I'll never forget how the depression and loneliness felt good and bad at the same time. Still does.”
